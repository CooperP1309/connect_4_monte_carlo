# connect_4_monte_carlo
The purpose of this project was to have a go at Python programming. Python experts
will scoff! 

The main source code is "connect_four_monte_carlo.py":
    - grid.py: Contains the grid/game board data structure and methods for representing the grid
    - gamerules.py: Contains methods such as check_win, apply_move, verify_move and so on
    - monte.py: This class contains the basis of the Monte algorithm itself
    - node.py: Contains the data structure for node data derived from Monte's simulations

There will be refinements and improvements to the algorithm. At it's initial
launch it is already proficient at beating humans.
